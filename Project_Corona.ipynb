    "### 1.1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset\n",
    "    - Data on deaths in different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Google's traffic data \n",
    "    - Google provides anonymized insights from products such as Google Maps for researchers to help them to make critical analysis to combat COVID-19. \n",
    "    - Google has divided their traffic data into six traffic components: \n",
    "        1. retail \\& recreation\n",
    "            - places like restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries and movie theaters\n",
    "        2. grocery \\& pharmacy\n",
    "            - places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores and pharmacies\n",
    "        3. parks\n",
    "            - places like national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas and public gardens\n",
    "        4. transit stations\n",
    "            - places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus and train stations\n",
    "        5. workplaces \n",
    "            - places of work\n",
    "        6. residential \n",
    "            -  places of residence\n",
    "     \n",
    "  - These components do not tell anything how much time people spend in each section on average but they still give a lot of information how people's traffic behavior changed during the pandemic\n",
    " \n",
    " - The traffic data's baseline is counted as a median value of multiple days. Day-to-day changes should not be emphasized too much because they are effected on many different factors, f.e. the weather and public events.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Moral behind the Bayesian model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getting the traffic data down slows down the spread of the virus. \n",
    "    - Several articles (Ferretti et al 2020, ECDC report, LSHTM report) have pointed out pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic  infections  play  a  significant  role  in  the  spread  of  COVID-19.  Indeed,  this observation  is  an  argument  it  may  not  be  enough  to  get  the  symptomatic  cases  to  stay at  home. Also  governmental  restrictions  should  be  implemented  to  get people’s movement down and furthermore the pandemic under control.\n",
    "    - Essentially, the reason to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions is to get people's traffic data down!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are multiple reasons why it makes sense to analyse European countries in this research\n",
    "    - COVID-19 hit European countries badly during autumn\n",
    "    - European governments have similar capabilities to restrict their citizens movement in comparison to many countries, f.e. China\n",
    "    - European countries adapted suppression strategy instead of mitigation one\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- There are many major differences between European countries which effect on the spread of COVID-19\n",
    "    - Examples: different age distributions, different population densities in cities, cultural differences\n",
    "    - Therefore comparisons between European countries should be avoided\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The COVID-19-case data is not reliable at least as the only measure about the development of the epidemic. COVID-19-death data has many benefits compared to the COVID-19 case data! \n",
    "    - The amount of testing varies a lot between countries\n",
    "    - Also using death data over infected data has the benefit that deaths measures much better country's success against the epidemic than infections\n",

Notice that the group removed $R$ includes everyone who is either recovered from the disease, isolated or died because of it. The changes of these groups can be described by the following equations:\n",

    "\n",
    "$D_e \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the latent period of the disease. \n",
    "Furthermore, $D_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the period how long both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are going to spread the disease before getting noninfectious, dead or isolated from other population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, $\\beta(t)$ is the average daily rate how many people the infected $I$ are going to meet inside the population. We fix this rate with Google's traffic components with the equation \n",
